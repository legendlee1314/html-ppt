        - h2: Abstract
        - ul:
            - li: A computational architecture.
            - li: focus on the problem of dynamic integrating.
            - li: object-based software technology (OOP)

        - h2: Grand Challenge
        - ul:
            - li: The Grand challenge for IEEE Robotics and Automation Society
            - li: The system issue may prevent research / application development

        - p: This paper is describing a system architecture to address the grand challenge.

        - h2: design a good system architecture
        - p: IMA - The Intelligent Machine Architecture

        - h2: what's a architecture?
        - p: A set of organizing principles and core components that are used to build the basis for the system.

        - h2: what a good architecture should be?
        - p: Be like their IMA.

        - h2: system decomposition

        - h3: agent
        - p: 
             IMA is agent-based.  The term Agent is very popular at that time.

        - h3: knowledge-based
        - p: excel at applying knowledge, work by exchanging/manipulating knowledge

        - h3: behavior-based(newer), approaches
        - ul: 
            - li: strict priority
            - li: voting schemes
            - li: spreading activation mechanism
        - h3: hybrid
        - p: can have advantages from both knowledge-based and behavior-based system decomposition.

        - h3: A service robotics benchmark
        - p: Test the IMA using robots ISAC and Helpmate.
